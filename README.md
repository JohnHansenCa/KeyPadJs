# KeyPadUI
Typescript project providing a runtime configurable keypad that is primarily targeted for calculator style applications. 

There are 3 primary ways to configure a keypad using KeyPadUI.
1. Using Html/CSS markup with a small amount of javascript.
2. A mixture of Html/CSS markup and javascript.
3. Exculsively with Javascript.

KeyPadUi:
- makes extensive use of defaults so that a minimal amount of configuration is required but still providing significant control.
- provides only a thin vineer of javascript wrapping native CSS and HTML functionality.
